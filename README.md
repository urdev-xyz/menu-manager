## What is Menu Manager.
ur menu manager is a platform we are currently buiilding for several of our existing clients and potential future ones to streamline the adding and removal of menu items as they wish. We also hope to create several analytic tools that can provide useful info on what products are grossing the most interest. If you wish to contribute please remember that this project doesn't plan on being a open platform right now but we don't disscourage any outside use.
